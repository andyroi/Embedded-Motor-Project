# Embedded-Motor-Project
* The project will include the c file along with other files that uses MCUX IDE to program the motorized robot
  # Robot Hardware
  * The robot used the FRDM (insert model name)
  * Motor Device that has different connection ports
  * Breadboard
  * Two Motors
  * 5 Voltage batterypack
  # Connections
  * (Put image here)
  # Software
  * MCUX IDE
  # Algorithm
  * Simple basic C programming, the main idea is to understand how the pins are called and setup
# Explanation of pins
* The PWM module will use a TPM module based on the schematics on this link:
  * (provide link here)
* Then links provided from the image above will be GPIO which will toggle the motors "direction", this table below will explain which direction it'll go into.:
